    "We use sckit's NMF library with 15 components to recommend movies. The resulting RMSE is 1672 which is extremely high meaning we can probalby improve this model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is probably because sckit's NMF library has several limitations like how it treats missing data as observed rather than missing. This leads to suboptimal results in some cases. A potential solution for this would be to refine the NMF algorithm to handle this or to consider alternative libraries which are able to handle this.\n",

    "Another issue is that scikit's NMF lacks regularization which increases its susceptibility to overfitting. This can be addressed by implementing a regularized versions of NMF or using regularization matrix factorization techniques.\n",

    "Finally, scikit's NMF faces limitations for recommender systems compared to similarity-based methods. Solving this will probably involve alternative libraries, regularization techniques, and explicit modeling of biases."
